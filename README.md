# Brain_age_regression
In the first part, we implement a U-net to do the brain segementation. And then use the volumn of each kind of tissue to do the regression. In part2, we apply the PCA to decrease the amount of feature of the grey brain MRI picture and do the regression. In part3, we use the end to end model  and directly predict the age by using the neural network.
